In progress tool for targeting insertion of microelectrodes
based on 2-photon imaging of the vasculature; 
also developing the capability to provide an assessment
of damage to vasculature caused by probe insertion.

Requirements:
    python, numpy, scipy (0.11.0 or greater)

Use:

    ./vasc-target path probe-length probe-width

where *path* is the path to the folder with your 2-photon
      tif data and xml metadata file

      *probe-length* is the length of your probe in microns

      *probe-width* is the width of your probe in microns

see ./vasc-target -h for more options.
