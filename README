In progress tool for vasculature-based microelectrode 
insertion targetting based on 2-photon microscopy data; 
also developing the capability to provide an assessment
of damage to vasculature caused by probe insertion.

Use:
(1) configuration
    create config.py file in directory with path to
    folder holding tiff image stack and xml metadata
(2) execution
    run './ptarg.py'
    
This tool is utterly and completely fluid and in 
progress. It is subject to complete change at any
time.
